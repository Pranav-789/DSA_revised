📚 DSA Revision Journey – From Basics to Graphs 🚀

Welcome to my DSA Revision Repository!
This repo is a collection of codes and concepts I’m revisiting as I strengthen my Data Structures and Algorithms knowledge — step-by-step, from the very basics to complex topics like Graphs.


🔍 Purpose

This repository serves as:

✅ A personal learning archive
✅ A revision companion
✅ A structured roadmap for consistent DSA practice
✅ A tracker of my growth in problem-solving skills


📘 Topics Covered

✅ Basics (Input/Output, Loops, Arrays, Strings, etc.)
✅ Sorting & Searching
✅ Recursion & Backtracking
✅ Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
✅ Trees & Binary Trees
✅ Binary Search Trees (BST)
✅ Heaps & HashMaps
✅ Tries
✅ Graphs (BFS, DFS, Topo Sort, etc.) *(Coming Soon...)

🎯 Resources I'm Following

Here’s a mix of structured roadmaps and problem-solving platforms that I refer to:

🌟 [Striver’s DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/)
💡 [Love Babbar's CodeHelp DSA Sheet](https://www.codehelp.in)
📚 [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
🧠 [CodeStudio (now Coding Ninjas)](https://www.codingninjas.com/studio)
🧩 [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)



🛠️ How This Repo is Structured

Each folder/topic contains:

🔹 Neatly written code with comments
🔹 Frequently asked problems
🔹 Notes or logic behind the solution (wherever helpful)



🚧 Work in Progress...

This repo is being updated actively. Stay tuned as I tackle more advanced topics and refine solutions!
